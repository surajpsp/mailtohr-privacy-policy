  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Effective Date: April 13, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the "Mail to HR" mobile application ("we", "our", or "us") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a safe experience while using our app.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Mail to HR</strong> does not collect any personal data from users. All operations, such as uploading, viewing, or sending resumes, are handled locally on your device.</p>

  <h2>2. File Access Permission</h2>
  <p>The app may request access to your deviceâ€™s storage to allow you to select and attach resume files. This permission is used solely for user-initiated actions and no data is uploaded or shared externally.</p>

  <h2>3. No Internet Tracking</h2>
  <p>We do not use any tracking tools, analytics services, or third-party SDKs that collect user data. Your information stays private and on your device.</p>

  <h2>4. AI Integration</h2>
  <p>The app may generate email subject lines or messages using AI, based on the resume content you upload. This feature works locally or with third-party AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI) if enabled. If data is ever sent to such services, it is not stored or reused for any purpose other than generating content for your email.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>No user data is stored or retained by us. All data remains on your device and can be removed at any time by deleting the app or its files.</p>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Mail to HR is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Changes will be posted on this page with a new effective date. Continued use of the app after updates implies your acceptance of the changes.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, feel free to contact us at:</p>
